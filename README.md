# Applications_Linked_Lists

This repository demonstrates various practical applications of **linked lists** in C. Linked lists are fundamental data structures that allow efficient memory usage and flexible insertions/deletions, making them ideal for a range of algorithmic problems.

- **ADD_TWO_NUMS.c**  
  Program to add two large numbers, each represented as a linked list where every node contains a single digit.
- **poly_addition.c**  
  Program to perform addition of two polynomials using linked lists, where each node represents a term (coefficient and exponent).

## How It Works

### Adding Two Numbers Using Linked Lists

- Each number is input as a sequence of digits.
- Digits are stored in nodes of a linked list.
- The lists are traversed to add the numbers as you would on paper, digit by digit, managing carry-overs.

### Polynomial Addition Using Linked Lists

- Each term of a polynomial (coefficient and exponent) is stored in a node.
- The polynomials are added by traversing the lists and combining like terms (same exponents).
